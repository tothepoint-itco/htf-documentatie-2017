# Challenge: Palindrome

### Situation

Europe is having issue with drug trafficking. To speed up the process of scanning medication to see if it is illegal or not, they invented a machine that scans all substances that are processed to fabricate it.
To make it more easy they named all substances that are illegal with a numeric code that is a palindrome. Now they only need a program that 
helps them figure out which code is a palindrome so they can start investigating where all the drugs are coming from.
