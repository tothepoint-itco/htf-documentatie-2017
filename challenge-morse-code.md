# Challenge: Morse code

### Situation

A big powersurge caused the communication equipment in Nigeria to break down. Since a big terrorist organisation has taken over their governement, they want to ask for help from one of their neighbours. The only thing that they have left to communicate with is morse code. Since they also receive messages in morse, they need help deciphering them.

### Problem
* You get a long string of 0 and 1
* You have to translate this to morse code first and then turn it into letters to produce a word/sentence

##### Rules
* "Dot" – is 1 time unit long.
* "Dash" – is 3 time units long.
* Pause between dots and dashes in a character – is 1 time unit long.
* Pause between characters inside a word – is 3 time units long.
* Pause between words – is 7 time units long.
